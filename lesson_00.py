print("Ashley")
# Step 1 - Print your name in console

fav_Show = "Avatar: The Last Airbender"
# Step 2 - Create a variable (in snake case) to store your favorite show

float_Point = 2.5
birth_Month = 5
# Step 3 - Using snake case, make variables with a float and integer 

print(float_Point * birth_Month)
# Step 4 - Print the product of the previous 2 variables

fav_foods = ['macaroni & cheese', 'potato salad', 'cheesescake']
# Step 5 - Create a variable that stores your favorite foods (atleast 3)

age = 17
if age >= 18:
    print("You can get a driver's license")
else: 
    print("You cannot get a driver's license")
# Step 6 - Create an if statement that tells someone if they can drive

name = input("What is your name?: ")
print(name)
#Step 7 - Ask the user for their name and print it into the console

for i in fav_foods:
    print(i)
# Step 8 - Create a for loop that prints each of your favorite foods

while fav_foods:
    break
# Step 9 - Create a while loop that will never run
